# Pac-Man
a JavaScript function that moves an image of a Pac-Man character across a web page. The function, called Run, updates the image's src attribute and style.left property to change its position and appearance. The function is called repeatedly at a set interval using setInterval. The checkPageBounds function is called to check if the Pac-Man character has reached the edge of the page, in which case its direction is reversed. The pos and direction variables are used to track the character's position and direction. The pacArray variable is an array of arrays containing the file paths of the different Pac-Man images. The focus variable is used to switch between the images in the array.
