# Pac-Man
## A JavaScript function that moves an image of a Pac-Man character across a web page, changing its appearance and direction at set intervals.

How to Run:
To use this function, include it in your JavaScript code and call it repeatedly at a set interval using setInterval. The pos and direction variables should be initialized to track the character's position and direction. The pacArray variable should be defined as an array of arrays containing the file paths of the different Pac-Man images. The focus variable can be used to switch between the images in the array.

Roadmap of future improvements:
There are several potential improvements that could be made to this function in the future. For example, the movement of the Pac-Man character could be made more smooth or responsive by using different CSS properties or by implementing animation techniques. The function could also be modified to include additional features such as user interaction or game mechanics.
